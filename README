compare-cores, version 1.2
--------------------------

This perl script parses moo database files and generates a report of
differnece between two lily cores.  This is intended initially for us to use
to sync up the rpi core with the devcore.

The more long term goal is to build a second script that will do these
comparisons (plus some intelligence as to what changes are normal!) to build
patch files to upgrade any core to each new version as we release them in 
the future.
